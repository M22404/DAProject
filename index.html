                        Gaming as an industry has been growing over the years and has certainly grown exponentially at
                        the height of the pandemic, with games like "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" and "Among Us"
                        booming in popularity. Hence, I would like to study the overall amount of players it brought to

                        The video game industry has been growing for the past couple of years, with many new games being
                        developed and released at all times. Many of these games are developed by big game studios,
                        which have hundreds of people and have massive amounts of funding, allowing them to dedicate a
                        lot of financial resources and manpower to developing their games. These games are what people
                        call Triple-A games, or AAA games, games that are distributed by large companies that are
                        well-known, such as Sony and Microsoft.
                        However, there has been some negative stigma that has started to surround AAA games. Due to a
                        variety or reasons, such as microtransactions, incomplete buggy released games and the lack of
                        risk-taking, many of the AAA games that have been recently released have been widely regarded as
                        being poorer in quality and being more lackluster to play. This is largely due to the focus of
                        these AAA game studios becoming more on profits than creating a truly enjoyable game, putting
                        quantity over quality.
                        Since AAA games are on the decline, this leaves a gap in the video game industry to be filled.
                        This is where indie games come in. Indie games are games that are developed by small groups of
                        individuals without the technical and financial resources that a AAA game studio has. Due to
                        this, the scope of indie games are usually much more limited than that of AAA games, and it can
                        be hard for indie game developers to develop a game without much support from a large team.
                        Despite this, however, many indie games are extremely high in quality and can be compared to
                        that of AAA games, perhaps even higher in quality than AAA games. indie game developers also
                        have the freedom to create whatever game idea they want, something that AAA game studios do not
                        have, resulting in a greater variety of indie games.
                        The popularity of indie games is quickly rising in popularity, not only among consumers, but
                        also among game developers. Gamers are starting to see the appeal of indie games, increasing the
                        demand for them. Many of the games that are sold on Steam, which is one of the most popular
                        video game distribution services, are indie games, showing that many gamers want to purchase and
                        play indie games. Indie games are also encouraging more individuals to begin their journey in
                        game development, with more tools and services to help them develop indie games becoming
                        available recently. One of these services is itch.io, which is a website where anybody can host
                        and sell their own indie games independently. While it is not as popular as Steam is as a video
                        game distribution service, it is focused completely on indie games, allowing indie developers to
                        publish and sell their own passion projects online.
                        Therefore, I would like to analyse the rise in popularity in indie games for both consumers and
                        game developers, as well as how they compare to AAA games.

                        In recent years, live streaming has emerged globally due to the internet, with many people in
                        the world today either consuming such content, or are creating it themselves, through various
                        live streaming platforms. Two of these platforms, Twitch and Youtube, have grown to become large
                        content hubs, covering millions of hours of content and many viewers. Twitch, especially, is a
                        content hub focused on the live streaming of games. In this project, I aim to analyze the
                        popularity of these platforms, the changing viewership of live streaming content creators on
                        these platforms (also called 'live streamers'), as well as the content of those streams.

                        is the question I wish to analyse. The motivation behind this project was visiting an amusement
                        for the first time since the pandemic struck, and realising that there were already many people
                        there, so I wanted to know how and when people started coming back. The goal is to have a better

                        Wordle was created in mid-2021 (more specifically, the game refers to 20 June 2021 as the first
                        Wordle) by software engineer John Wardle, who created the game for his girlfriend as he knew she
                        liked word games. The couple played for months, and after it became a hit in family group chats,
                        the game was released to the public in October 2021. The game has since become a worldwide
                        sensation, with millions of people playing it worldwide.
                        The free-to-play online word guessing game involves players having to guess a 5 letter word in 6
                        tries. It has a single daily solution, and all players attempt to guess the same word. The game
                        was purchased from creater Josh Wardle by The New York Times Company in January 2022.
                        As someone who plays Wordle on a daily basis, I was intrigued to explore Wordle in a more
                        analytical fashion. In this project, I will look into Wordle's growth (and decline) and
                        popularity, as well as analyze players' posted results.

                        Tourism has always been a huge part of entertainment, for people to relax and enjoy themselves.
                        Tourism is an important source of income and employment for developed and developing countries.
                        Unfortunately, COVID-19 disrupted this sector immensely and the tourism industry plummeted.
                        Tourism can be regarded as a social, cultural and economic phenomenon related to the movement of
                        people outside their usual place of residence. Some different types of tourism include domestic
                        tourism, inbound tourism, and outbound tourism. Domestic tourism comprises the activities of a
                        resident visitor within the country of reference. Inbound tourism comprises the activities of a
                        non-resident visitor within the country of reference. Finally, outbound tourism is comprises of
                        the activities of a resident visitor outside the country of reference.
                        In this project, I will be analysing the number of departures and arrivals. Through this
                        project, I would like to know every country's popularity in outbound, inbound, and domestic
                        tourism. Through this, we can learn the popularity and reputation of different countries in
                        other countries. I will only be analysing the data from 1995 to 2019, before the COVID-19
                        pandemic. I will also be finding correlations of the popularity with other variables.

                        Scrabble is a game where players construct words out of letters. Each letter has a preset value
                        based on its frequency, and these values are used to determine how many points each play made by
                        a player is worth. However, a higher tile value does not correspond to a more generally valuable
                        tile, and it even may be the opposite. Hence, I would like to discover what the true value of
                        these tiles are, along with other aspects of competitive play in scrabble, by analyzing datasets
                        of games in scrabble competitions since 2005, with upwards of 4000 games to look at.

                        Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is a team sport where opposing
                        sides face off against one another to shoot a basketball into a hoop mounted 3 meters above the
                        ground. This sport has had a great cultural impact worldwide and changed society.
                        Throughout the tides of time, basketball has always stood out as a beacon of entertainment. The
                        biggest source of basketball entertainment has consistently been the NBA, to the point where
                        they have become the central authority of the sport. I wish to analyze how the sport has changed
                        over the years, specifically with the NBA. It would be very interesting to know how viewership,
                        players and tactics have fluctuated over the years, and see how significant world events like
                        covid-19 has impacted the sport.

                        Movies are a huge portion of the entertainment industry, with the movie industry approximately
                        worth more than $100 billion globally. Movies are a popular and widespread form of entertainment
                        amongst people, with top movies grossing millions of dollars at the box office. However, as
                        movies require a lot of initial capital to produce, they can be a risky endeavour for investors
                        and production companies alike.
                        Hence, it is important for the movie industry to find out the different factors that affect the
                        revenue that a movie generate, and maximise the quality of production, as well as the optimal
                        time to release a movie.

                        like "addiction" and "wasting money". However, at the core of it, gambling is a form of
                        entertainment that deals with chance and luck and in reality is not limited to adults. Gachapon
                        machines in Japan for example is a form of "gambling" targeted at mostly children. The

                        Eve Online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game, or MMORPG for short, set in
                        space. To go out of the space stations and explore in Eve, you need to use space ships. Each of
                        the different ships has different attributes. One of these attributes is slots. In these slots
                        you can fit modules which increase the capabilities of your ship. There is obviously some
                        strategy as to which modules you would put on your ship. It is well known, for example, that you
                        should not bring a pickaxe to a gunfight.
                        By using ship data from Eve, I would be able to not only gain insight into the different
                        strategies for fitting modules on ships, I would also be able to know how the general community
                        acts in this way. Potentially, this could have a link to wider human psychology.
                        There is one main goal: To find out the most common situations where given modules are used.

                        American crosswords are word puzzles, the goal is to fill in all the white squares with
                        letters to fit the given clues, with usually 1 correct answer. The special rules of American
                        crosswords are that each square must be used twice and each word has to be at
                        least 3 letters long. The answers are a mix of trivia and common phrases. These rules may cause
                        limitations in answers, causing obscure words to be used, lowering accessibility by the general
                        public. Historically, constructors have been white men, leading to a glaring lack of

                        Music is a very popular form of entertainment, that has greatly changed throughout the years.
                        From the old radio and television methods, and now Youtube and Spotify, discovering new music
                        has never been easier. But how has this affected the industry? Are digital sales increasing the
                        revenue of the music industry, or is it decreasing it? Is Spotify helping newer artists be
                        heard, or is it suppressing them? Are popular songs nowadays reaching more people, as Spotify's
                        userbase has grown? Are they getting shorter? Is popular music getting better or worse, based on
                        critic's opinions?

                        Counter Strike: Global Offensive, CSGO for short, has been the bread and butter of Esports for 9
                        years. CSGO is a 5v5 tactical First-Person-Shooter. Teams compete against each other in
                        different CSGO maps, where one team plays as the Terrorists and the other as Counter-Terrorists,
                        each with different game objectives. Teams buy weapons based off of their economy, which is
                        affected by their personal performance as well as round wins. I want to explore on the trends of
                        professional players, the patterns in the games by using Data Analytics to gain a deeper
                        insight, albeit one that is still quite shallow as compared to real CSGO analysts VOD-reviewing
                        the gameplay itself and studying the teams, players, and their decisions frame by frame.
